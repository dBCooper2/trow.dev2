dBI was a project meant to be an evolution of my previous project, the Portfolio Viewing Script. The goal of this project was to take data from the TDA API and create tools for analyzing this data and visualizing it. While working on this project, I decided to dive deeper into financial analysis and left the TDA part behind after the Schwab merger.

The code for the project can be found [here](<https://github.com/dBCooper2/dBI>), and projects in a similar vein that I will continue to work on can be found in my [pythonic finance](<https://github.com/dBCooper2/pythonic-finance>) repository.
