(This program no longer works after the Schwab-TDA merger, I am waiting for the Schwab API to finish getting set up before revisiting this project)

This project was a way for me to learn how to use TD Ameritrade's API using Alex Golec's tda-api package (now schwab-py). The program would use chromedriver or geckodriver to login to the API, and would return a JSON of account data, which was cleaned and converted into a quick dashboard, where users could view their account positions at a glance with a shell script. This project taught me about using API's with Python, writing shell scripts to run the python scripts from the CLI, and creating jobs in cron to automate the process.
