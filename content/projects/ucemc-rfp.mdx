For the final project in my DS 3841 - Management Information Systems class, we were tasked with writing an RFP and a SWOT Analysis of a theoretical helpdesk service for the Upper Cumberland Electric Membership Corporation. This project taught me a lot about the process of writing an RFP, what factors to consider given a SWOT analysis, and how to clearly describe a request for vendors.

The writing samples for this project can be found [here](<https://github.com/dBCooper2/UCEMC-RFP-and-SWOT-Analysis>).
