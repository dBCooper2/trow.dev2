This was the final project for my DS 3860 - Database Management class. As a part of a team, I was tasked with creating an SQL database for a theoretical vendor. This database is equipped with triggers to handle orders and inventory changes. The documentation and code can be found [here](<https://github.com/dBCooper2/ACME_INC_SQL>).
