The goal of this site is not just to share my work and create a portfolio for myself, but also to be as close to a no-code website editor as possible. At Tennessee Tech University, the Business Department was very focused on having students create an E-Portfolio to share their work. While I like the no-code editors fine enough, particularly Wordpress and Wix, I was left unsatisfied. 

After going through a journey of first forking [Kostas Georgiou's Portfolio](<https://www.gkos.dev>) and creating [a version for myself](<https://dbcooper.vercel.app>), then creating [my own](<https://trevor-rowland.vercel.app>) site using typescript, I have finally found a version that I think fits all of my needs, thanks to [MDX](<https://mdxjs.com/>) and [Jolly Coding](<https://www.youtube.com/@JollyCoding>).

This website is itself a fork of Jolly Coding's [NextJS 14 Blog](<https://github.com/jolbol1/nextjs-velite-blog-template>) (a tutorial to make it yourself can be found [here](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSI98g3PDyE&t=5062s>)). Using MDX and a few simple config files, it should be trivial to copy this repo and make it your own!
